# Bird sound generation
* Bird: 五色鳥
* Model
    * Handcraft Elman RNN with ReLU activation
    * Sampling Rate: 16000
    * Generated sequence: 48000
        * preprocess using ML_Diffusion
* Audio output
    * how to use Pmod to make generated sound
    * how to store the generated result
        * 2 FPGA boards?
